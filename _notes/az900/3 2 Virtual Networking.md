# 3.2 Virtual Networking

Azure Virtual Network is a service that provides the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. A virtual network is similar to a traditional network that you'd operate in your own datacenter. But it brings extra benefits of the Azure infrastructure, such as scale, availability, and isolation.

- Present inside Azure Private Network Base
- Secure and efficient communication.
- Connectivity to the internet and on-premise networks.

### Key Features

- Isolation and Segmentation. VNET allows us to create multiple segments, within Azure network.
- Internet communication, inbound and outbound access controls.
- Communication with on-premises, secure cross premises connectivity.

### Benefits

- Customizable network topology, we can tailor topology to the unique need of the applications.
- Enhanced security, through network security groups(NSGs), and firewalls to manage traffic flows.
- Integration with the Azure services, other key services can also be allocated to the VNETs.

### Use Case

- Secure Azure Service Connection
- Links between Azure networks and on-premises
