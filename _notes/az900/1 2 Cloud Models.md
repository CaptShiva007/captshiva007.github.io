# 1.2 Cloud Models

The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. 

- Private Cloud
    
    > Distinct and secure environment that is built within customer’s datacenter.
    > 
    - It’s a cloud delivering services that is used by a single entity.
    - Provides greater control for the company and its IT department.
    - Greater cost, fewer benefits than public cloud.
    - Can be hosted from your onsite datacenter, or a dedicated offsite datacenter, potentially even by a third party that has a dedicated datacenter for the company.
    - Provides greater control and exclusivity i.e. full control over resources and data
    - Company is solely responsible for operating and securing services, infrastructure ,software and platform. No reliance on external assets.
    - Higher data security and operational performance.
    
    ### Challenges in Private:
    
    - Hardware cost, maintenance responsibility.
- Public Cloud
    
    > Secure environment owned and operated by provider.
    > 
    - Owned and operated by cloud service provider, amazon, azure, oracle, etc.
    - Multi-tenant model, uses same hardware but the data is isolated.
    - Uses secure VPN connection for accessing the remote resources, for example, azure portal.
    - Deploy on demand, optimize resources, pay only for services availed.
- Hybrid Cloud
    
    > Combination of both public and private cloud principles.
    > 
    - Security of private cloud, scalability of public cloud.
    - Flexible application hosting.
    - Sensitive data hosted in private cloud, public facing services hosted in public cloud.
