# 5.8 Zero Trust

It is a security model based on the principle that organizations should not automatically trust anything, whether inside or outside the perimeter. Instead they should verify everything trying to connect to their systems before granting access.

### Principles of Zero Trust

1. Verify explicitly
2. Use least privilege access 
3. Assume Breach

### 1. Verify Explicitly

- Authenticate and authorize with all data points
- Data points include user identity, location, device health, the workload, etc.

### 2. Use Least Privilege Access

- Limit access with just in time policies
- Apply just enough access policies
- Utilize risk-based adaptive policies

### 3. Assume Breach

- Segment access by network, user, and devices. Assumes that breaches can happen.
- Ensure encrypted sessions.
- Utilize analytics for threat detection.
