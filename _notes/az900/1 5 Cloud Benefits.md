# 1.5 Cloud Benefits

1. High availability
2. Elasticity.
3. Predictability.
4. Governance
5. Reliability
6. Security.
7. Manageability.
8. Scalability.

### High Availability:

- Running services that are critical to organization, carrying out operations even during unforeseen outages. This ensures that
    1. Customer facing services are always available.
    2. Minimize downtime.
    3. Prevent revenue loss.
    4. Maintain customer trust.
    
    > This is achieved through a geographically diverse networks of datacenters. Even if one goes offline, the load is balanced to the other available datacenters.
    > 
    
    > Availability of redundant hardware(redundancy).
    > 

### Scalability:

- Scalability means the ability to grow along with the business, let’s say the corp is developing fast the resources have to be scalable so that it is reliable for the business.
    1. Efficient Scaling, without changing physical infrastructure.
    2. Scaling based on demand unlike on premise infra, shortage during peaks, under utilization during non seasonal times.
    3. Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling:
        - **Vertical Scaling:** When we add more to existing machines, such as more RAM, more Memory, more bandwidth, etc.
        - **Horizontal Scaling:** When we add more machines to the network, like adding a fleet of servers.
    4. With scaling we can achieve cost effective growth.

### Predictability:

- The ability to predict cost, performance, behavior of cloud resources.
- On premise infra can cause cost spikes, budgeting challenges, unpredictable performance impact, resource allocation issues, etc.
- The cloud infra provides us tools to monitor, manage, predict the cloud spending and performance.

### Governance:

- Governance is key to ensure that operations run smoothly and securely.
- Governance is hard in on premise infrastructure due to inconsistency, complex audit, data protection assurance, operational integrity maintenance.
- Cloud provides governance and compliance tools that helps business to define, enforce, and monitor governance policies across the cloud environments.
- This includes Automated compliance checks, policy enforcement, simplifying governance

> DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ELASTICITY AND SCALABILITY
> 

> Scalability is a capability of a system to handle a growing amount of load by adding resources to the system. In contrast, elasticity is the ability of a system to adapt to the workload changes by provisioning and deprovisioning resources in autonomous manner.
> 

### Elasticity:

- Elasticity is ability of a system to dynamically adjust its resource allocation to meet changing demands.
- On premises lack features such as unpredictable traffic bursts, lack of scaling response
- Elasticity provides dynamic resource allocation, and automatic scaling, cost-efficient resource usage.

### Reliability:

- Reliability is the ability of a system’s services, applications and data to be always accessible to the users and are protected against failures, data loss or corruption. A foundational pillar.
- In on-premises infra we lack continuous accessibility, data protection priority, fast incident recovery.
- Cloud offers disaster recovery operations, data integrity assurance, service continuity measures, minimize downtime and loss.

### Security:

- Security is safeguarding of data and maintaining trust from various cybersecurity threats.
- In on-premises we lack Rapid evolution of threats, data breach risks, unauthorized access, protecting customer trust.
- Cloud provides wide array of features to prevent cyberthreats such as network security, data encryption, identity management, threat detection

### Manageability:

- Manageability is the ability to manage and monitor the system infrastructure.
- In on-premises we face issues such as operational efficiency, performance optimization, cost management,
- Cloud provides the users with automation and management tools that simplifies the administration of cloud resources thus in turn provides centralized monitoring, automated tuning, resource optimization.
