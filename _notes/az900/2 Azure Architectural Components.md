# 2. Azure Architectural Components

Weâ€™ll deal with:

1. Regions and Availability Zones.
2. Subscription and Resource Groups.

### Regions and Availability Zones:

- Azure is vast and intricate network with numerous amount of data centers.
- These data centers are organized into geographical regions, designed to bring applications closer to the users around the world, ensuring speed and availability.
- Within the geographical regions, availability zones are created as a unique physical locations with independent power, cooling and networking to ensure resilience against failures.

### Subscription and Resource Groups:

- Subscriptions act as a primary billing unit within azure which allows us to manage cost and resources by grouping them under single billing account.
- Resource groups are containers that hold related solutions necessary for azure solutions.
- By using resource groups we can efficiently manage and monitor resources collectively, apply access policies and automate tasks with greater ease.
